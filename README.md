## Part 1
The repository is about learning the art of function writing. Being able to write own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments. Gaining insights into scoping in Python and being able to write lambda functions and handling errors in your function writing practice.
